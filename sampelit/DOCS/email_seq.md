# Email Sequence - Post Simulator

## EMAIL 1 — Immediate (After email submit)

**Subject:** You're now observing a live copy experiment

**Body:**

You just used the impact simulator.

Here's what's happening now:

- This landing is running 9 copy variants
- Traffic is distributed automatically
- Variants gain or lose exposure based on performance
- Results are evaluated only when confidence is sufficient

### Current Status

Experiment status: **Active**  
Best uplift so far: **+21%**  
Confidence: **89%**

### Important Note

These results are not final.

Copy testing requires patience.  
Premature conclusions are how money is lost.

**CTA:** View the live dashboard

**Footer:**

You're not being sold to.

We'll email again when:
- confidence increases
- a variant clearly wins
- or we learn something worth sharing

## EMAIL 2 — Day +2 (Education)

**Subject:** Why most copy tests give misleading results

**Body:**

Three reasons copy tests fail:

**1. Too little traffic**  
Most tests declare winners before reaching statistical significance.

**2. Fixed splits**  
Traditional A/B testing wastes traffic on losing variants.

**3. Premature conclusions**  
"Winner" declared too early leads to false positives.

This is what we're trying to avoid.

Our system:
- Enforces minimum sample sizes
- Adapts traffic allocation
- Only declares winners with sufficient confidence

**No CTA** — pure education

## EMAIL 3 — Day +5 (Product transition)

**Subject:** You've seen the process

**Body:**

You've observed how the experiment works.

If your site converts between 1–10%,  
this system can usually uncover incremental improvements.

If not, you'll at least know.

### What you get:

- Controlled copy experiments
- Adaptive traffic allocation
- Statistical confidence tracking
- 14-day trial, no commitment

**CTA:** Start a 14-day trial

**Footer:** No pressure. No lock-in. You decide when it makes sense.
