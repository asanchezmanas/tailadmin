## ABOUT US PAGE

**URL:** `/about`

---

### Headline

We test copy so you don't have to guess.

### Subheadline

A system for running controlled experiments on landing page copy.  
Built by people who got tired of choosing headlines based on opinions.

---

### Section 1: What We Do

**Title:** What we're building

We're building a testing system for copy optimization.

**The problem it solves:**

Most teams choose copy based on:
- Internal opinions
- Founder preferences
- What "feels right"
- Copying competitors

**The result:** Revenue left unrealized because you don't know which version performs better.

**What we provide:**

A way to measure which copy actually converts, using controlled experiments on real traffic.

Not guesswork. Not intuition. Measurement.

---

### Section 2: How It Started

**Title:** Why we built this

We were running a SaaS company.

Every landing page decision was a debate:
- Should the headline be emotional or rational?
- Should the CTA say "Start Trial" or "Get Started"?
- Should we explain features or benefits?

We had opinions. No data.

**Traditional A/B testing tools were:**
- Expensive (€300+/month)
- Complex (needed dedicated resources)
- Slow (manual traffic allocation, weeks to results)

We wanted something simpler, faster, and designed specifically for copy testing.

So we built it.

---

### Section 3: Our Approach

**Title:** How we work

**1. We use our own product**

This landing page is currently running experiments.  
You're seeing one of multiple variants.  
We test our own copy before asking you to test yours.

**2. We publish our results publicly**

All experiments are documented at [/experiments](#).  
Including inconclusive tests and failures.  
Transparency > marketing.

**3. We don't promise miracles**

Testing doesn't create demand.  
It removes uncertainty about which copy works better.  
Not every test produces a winner. That's normal.

---

### Section 4: What We're Not

**Title:** What this isn't

❌ **Not a full-stack A/B testing platform**  
We focus on copy, not layouts or complex UI changes.

❌ **Not a marketing agency**  
We provide the tool. You run the tests.

❌ **Not for everyone**  
If you have <2,000 monthly visits, traditional testing isn't viable yet.

❌ **Not magic**  
Won't fix poor product-market fit or bad positioning.  
Only optimizes what's already working.

---

### Section 5: Who This Is For

**Title:** Who we're building for

✓ SaaS companies with steady traffic  
✓ eCommerce sites testing product copy  
✓ B2B services optimizing landing pages  
✓ Founders who prefer data over opinions  
✓ Teams tired of endless debates about wording

**Not for:**
- Sites with <2,000 monthly visits (not enough traffic)
- Teams wanting to test visual design (we focus on copy)
- Companies needing enterprise sales process (we're self-service)

## FAQ PAGE (Optional but Recommended)

**URL:** `/faq`

---

### Headline

Frequently Asked Questions

### Subheadline

Common questions about how the system works, pricing, and technical details.

---

### General

**Q: What exactly does this do?**

A: It runs controlled copy experiments on your website. You create multiple versions of text (headlines, CTAs, etc.), and the system measures which performs better with real visitors.

---

**Q: How is this different from other A/B testing tools?**

A: We focus specifically on copy testing, not full-stack A/B testing. This makes setup simpler and results easier to interpret. We're also more transparent about methodology.

---

**Q: Do I need technical skills?**

A: Minimal. You need to add a JavaScript snippet to your site (similar to Google Analytics). After that, everything is point-and-click.

---

### Traffic Requirements

**Q: How much traffic do I need?**

A: Minimum 2,000 monthly visits for reliable results. With less traffic, tests take too long or produce unreliable results.

[Link to: "How much traffic do you need?" article]

---

**Q: What if I don't have enough traffic?**

A: Focus on growing traffic first, or test larger changes that are easier to detect. [Link to: "Low-traffic testing options" article]

---

### Testing Process

**Q: How long do tests take?**

A: Typically 2-4 weeks, depending on your traffic volume and the size of the difference between variants.

---

**Q: What if there's no clear winner?**

A: That's a valid result. It means the variants perform similarly, so you can choose based on other factors (brand alignment, ease of maintenance). [Link to: "When no clear winner is the right answer" article]

---

**Q: Can I test multiple things at once?**

A: You can run multiple experiments simultaneously on different pages. But on a single page, test one element at a time for clearest results.

---

### Privacy & Data

**Q: Do you collect data about my visitors?**

A: We only collect aggregated metrics (conversion rates, visit counts). No personal data, no tracking of individual users.

---

**Q: Is this GDPR compliant?**

A: Yes. We don't process personal data. Your visitors' privacy is maintained.

---

**Q: Who owns the test data?**

A: You do. You can export it anytime and it's deleted when you close your account.

---

### Pricing

**Q: How much does it cost?**

A: €49/month standard pricing. Early adopters get 50% off for the first year (€24/month).

---

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**

A: Yes. No long-term contracts, no cancellation fees.

---

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**

A: No refunds for partial months, but you can cancel anytime and access continues until the end of your billing period.

---

**Q: Are there enterprise plans?**

A: Not yet. Currently focused on self-service for small-medium teams.

---

### Technical

**Q: Does this work with [my CMS/platform]?**

A: If you can add JavaScript to your site, yes. Works with WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, custom sites, etc.

---

**Q: Will this slow down my site?**

A: No. The snippet is lightweight (<20KB) and loads asynchronously.

---

**Q: What browsers are supported?**

A: All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No IE11 support.

---

**Q: Can I see the methodology?**

A: Yes. General principles are explained [here](#). Specific implementation details remain proprietary.

---

### Getting Started

**Q: When can I start using this?**

A: Currently in private testing. Expected public launch: Q1 2026. [Join waitlist](#)

---

**Q: How long does setup take?**

A: ~10 minutes to add the snippet and create your first test. First results typically available within 2-3 weeks.
