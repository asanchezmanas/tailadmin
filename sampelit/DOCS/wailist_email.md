## COPY ALTERNATIVO SI NO QUIERES DESCUENTO

Si prefieres no dar 50% de descuento:

**Alternativa 1: Early access pricing**

"Early adopters: €39/month (€10 less than standard)  
Locked in for 12 months"

**Alternativa 2: Extended trial**

"Early adopters: 30-day trial instead of 14-day  
Full refund if not useful"

**Alternativa 3: Lifetime features**

"Early adopters: All future features included  
No tiered pricing for you"

**Recomendación:** 50% off first year es la más clara y atractiva para culturas racionales.

---

## PRINCIPIO CLAVE

**"Early adopters take risk. We compensate for risk."**

Esto es lógico, justo y respetable.  
No es descuento por "urgencia falsa".  
Es descuento por **timing real**.

Esto funciona MUY bien en:
- 🇨🇭 Suiza
- 🇩🇪 Alemania  
- 🇩🇰 Dinamarca
- 🇬🇧 UK
- 🇺🇸 Founders técnicos

Porque es honesto, no manipulador.
